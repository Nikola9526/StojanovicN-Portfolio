                <p>
                    Hello there, my name is Nikola Stojanovic and I am first year student at Humber College, Computer Programming 
                    Program.<br>
                    I am currently enrolled in the Computer Programming program, and as for my educational background, I attended Fanshawe College for Urban Planning and then worked at Amazon following that. Although I have never worked in computer programming, I hope to find a job in this field in the future.  WRIT will provide me with many opportunities to improve my writing skills, which is something I will need in my future profession.  I personally prefer in-person learning over online learning since you can interact with people, and it is more hands-on.
